# Feed-forward Likelihood Maximization for Gaussian-based Occupancy Prediction [ECCV 2026]

> [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.21373v1) | [Project Page](https://gcchen97.github.io/flm-occ/)

- Feed-forward Likelihood Maximization for Occupancy Prediction (FLM-Occ) learns to iteratively maximize the Gaussian likelihood over the voxel distribution (test-time unrolled optimization).
- This method largely simplifies the implementation of Gaussian-based occupancy prediction, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet-Occ dataset with significantly reduced computational cost.
- The superquadric-based implementation further improves the efficiency and accuracy.



## Installation
```bash
conda create -n flm_occ python=3.12
conda activate flm_occ

pip3 install torch torchvision
pip3 install lightning rotary_embedding_torch
# optional libs for logging
pip3 install tensorboard swanlab
```


## Dataset Preparation
1. Download the [Occ-ScanNet](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hongxiaoy/OccScanNet) dataset and the train/val split files from [EmbodiedOcc/data/occscannet](https://github.com/YkiWu/EmbodiedOcc/tree/main/data/occscannet)
2. Set up the folder structure:
```
/path/to/
├── occscannet/
│   ├── gathered_data/
│   ├── posed_images/
│   ├── train_final.txt
│   ├── train_mini_final.txt
│   ├── test_final.txt
│   ├── test_mini_final.txt
```
3. Modify the dataset path in `configs/scannet.py` or `configs/scannet_mini.py` to point to the downloaded dataset.


## Training
1. Modify the dataset path and depth anything v2 path in `configs/scannet.py` before training.
2. Modify the imported config file in `train.py` if you want to use a different config.
```bash
python train.py
```


## TODO List
- [ ] Add evaluation script
- [ ] Add pre-trained model weights
- [ ] Add visualization script
